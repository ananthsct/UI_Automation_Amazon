## Assumptions and challenges
While developing test cases, the following assumptions were made:
1. From the understanding of test-cases, I have modified few points.
2. I have chosen product with maximum ratings and minimum value
3. Only few data are read from JSON file
4. It was difficult to select the sub-menu of All-items
5. I tried to store all data in file.

## Notes:
1. Almost tried to implement modular approach
